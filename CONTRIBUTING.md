## Pull Requests

1. Fork the MBHFramework repository.
2. Create a new branch for each feature or improvement.
3. Send a pull request from each feature branch to the **develop** branch.

It is very important to separate new features or improvements into separate feature branches, and to send a
pull request for each branch. This allows us to review and pull in new features or improvements individually.

## Coding Style Guide

All pull requests must adhere to the [PSR-2 standard](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md).

## Unit Testing

All pull requests must be accompanied by passing unit tests and complete code coverage. The MBHFramework is looking for using phpunit for testing.
